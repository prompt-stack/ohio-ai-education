# Ohio Statewide AI Training: Core Mathematics Summary
## Key Numbers for 95,000 Educator Implementation

---

## **Executive Summary**

To train Ohio's 95,000 educators using TechCred funding, we need **450 active trainers** operating over **5 years**, generating **$200M+ in revenue** while creating **$5M+ annually in local trainer income**.

---

## **Core Mathematical Foundation**

### **Total Training Requirements**
```
95,000 educators ÷ 30 participants per trainer = 3,167 trainer sessions needed
```

### **Annual Trainer Capacity**
```
Each trainer delivers 4 cohorts per year × 30 participants = 120 educators annually
```

### **Total Active Trainers Required (5-Year Plan)**
```
95,000 educators ÷ 5 years = 19,000 educators per year
19,000 ÷ 120 capacity per trainer = 158 active trainers needed annually

Rounded up for operational buffer: 167 active trainers annually
Total trainer pool needed: 450 trainers (accounting for rotation, availability)
```

## **TechCred Funding Mathematics**

### **Original Calculation (Districts + ESCs Only)**
- **School Districts:** 600 × $180,000 = $108,000,000 annually
- **ESCs:** 51 × $180,000 = $9,180,000 annually
- **Subtotal:** $117,180,000 annually
- **Annual Participant Capacity:** 58,590 educators

### **Revised Calculation (All Educational Employers)**
- **School Districts:** 600 × $180,000 = $108,000,000
- **ESCs:** 51 × $180,000 = $9,180,000
- **JVSDs:** 50 × $180,000 = $9,000,000
- **Charter Schools:** 300 × $180,000 = $54,000,000
- **Higher Education:** 200 × $180,000 = $36,000,000
- **Total Annual Capacity:** $216,180,000
- **Annual Participant Capacity:** 108,090 educators

### **Implementation Timeline Impact**
```
Original Model: 95,000 ÷ 58,590 = 1.62 years minimum
Revised Model: 95,000 ÷ 108,090 = 0.88 years minimum

Practical Implementation: 3-5 years (operational constraints)
```

## **Funding Capture Analysis**

### **Conservative Scenario (25% Market Capture)**
```
25% of 1,201 employers = 300 employers participating
300 × $180,000 = $54,000,000 annually
300 × 90 participants = 27,000 educators annually
95,000 ÷ 27,000 = 3.5 years to complete
```

### **Moderate Scenario (50% Market Capture)**
```
50% of 1,201 employers = 600 employers participating  
600 × $180,000 = $108,000,000 annually
600 × 90 participants = 54,000 educators annually
95,000 ÷ 54,000 = 1.8 years to complete
```

### **Aggressive Scenario (75% Market Capture)**
```
75% of 1,201 employers = 900 employers participating
900 × $180,000 = $162,000,000 annually
900 × 90 participants = 81,000 educators annually  
95,000 ÷ 81,000 = 1.2 years to complete
```
