## Warren County ESC · School Year 2024-2025

Edit

Crafted AI professional development roadmap for Christie's team.
16s



Looking at your past work with Christie and the meeting notes, I can see you need to create an AI-focused professional development program for Warren County ESC. Based on the Woven Traditions structure you've used before, here's what I understand:

Key Requirements from the Meeting:

9-month series (avoiding December)
2-hour monthly sessions
Two cohorts: ESC leaders (23-27 administrators) and district superintendents
Base-level approach assuming minimal AI experience
Focus on practical tools and efficiency
Address FERPA compliance and data protection concerns
Build from Christie's current use of ChatGPT
Your Past Approach (from Woven Traditions):

Modular structure with clear competencies
Interactive activities and role-playing
Intersession assignments for practice
Case studies and small group discussions
Rationale → Desired Outcomes → Standards format
Focus on practical application
Would you like me to create a comprehensive AI Professional Development Plan that follows your established format but focuses on:

AI literacy and tool exploration
Responsible use and data governance
Practical applications for educational leadership
Integration with existing systems (Microsoft, Google)
Communication strategies for stakeholders
I can structure it with monthly modules that build on each other, include hands-on activities, and maintain your signature approach of connecting learning to real workplace challenges. Should I proceed with creating this plan?

# AI Leadership Professional Development Plan  Warren County ESC · School Year 2024‑2025 --- ## 1. At‑a‑Glance | Item | Detail | | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------

pasted

how's this as a revision?

Edit

Scrutinized revised plan, praised improvements and strategic enhancements.
12s





This revision is excellent! It's much more streamlined and implementation-ready than my draft. Here are the key improvements I see:

Strengths:

Concise format - The at-a-glance table and module snapshots make it easy to understand quickly
Specific dates - Actual calendar dates help with planning
Differentiated approach - Smart to have superintendents self-pace some modules
Credits/CEUs - Great incentive for participation
Assessment framework - The rubric provides clear expectations
Equity focus - Adding Module 7 on Equity, Bias & Community Engagement addresses a critical need
Practical deliverables - Parent-Friendly AI FAQ, vendor vetting matrix, etc.
Follow-up support - 30-60-90 day coaching ensures implementation
Particularly clever elements:

Flipping Module 4 to maximize hands-on time
Merging modules 6 & 7 to create space for equity
Weekly office hours + Slack for ongoing support
Baseline readiness survey before the program starts
Alignment with Christie's needs: ✓ 2-hour monthly sessions ✓ Addresses FERPA/SB 29 compliance ✓ Starts with basics but builds sophistication ✓ Focus on practical tools and efficiency ✓ Includes special education applications

The only thing I might add is ensuring Brandon's AI expertise and your soft skills facilitation approach are both clearly integrated throughout. But this is a really strong, professional program design that should serve Warren County ESC well!

how to get one of these? ## Understanding Credits, CEUs, and Digital Badges **Credits** are units used to measure educational achievement in various learning contexts. The terms in your query—graduate credit, CEU, and digital badge (Credly)—each represent different types of recognition for learning

pasted

how would we get appoved for :

Edit

Strategized accreditation process for professional development program.
2s


To get approved to offer these credentials for your AI Leadership Professional Development Plan:

1. Graduate Credit
Partner with an accredited university:

Contact education/leadership departments at local universities (Cincinnati area: UC, Xavier, Miami, Wright State)
Present your curriculum as a "Special Topics" or "Independent Study" course
University faculty member serves as instructor of record
You deliver content as "guest expert" or co-instructor
University handles registration, grading, transcripts
Typical requirements:

15 contact hours = 1 graduate credit (your 18 hours = 1+ credit)
Detailed syllabus with learning objectives
Assessment plan beyond attendance
Reading list/bibliography
Instructor qualifications (Brandon's expertise + your facilitation)
2. CEUs (Continuing Education Units)
Through IACET (International Association for Continuing Education & Training):

Apply as an Authorized Provider ($2,500-3,500 annually)
OR partner with existing IACET provider
Through Ohio Department of Education:

Register as approved provider for educator professional development
Submit application with curriculum details
Show alignment to Ohio educator standards
Typically requires $500-1,000 fee
Through Warren County ESC:

ESC may already be approved CEU provider
Work with Christie to use existing authorization
Document attendance, assessments, learning outcomes
3. Digital Badges (Credly)
Easiest to implement:

Create organizational account on Credly ($3,000-5,000/year)
Design badge with competencies, evidence requirements
No external approval needed
Can implement immediately
Alternative: Partner approach

Partner with organization that has Credly account
They issue badges on your behalf
Lower cost, shared branding
Recommended Approach
Start with CEUs through ESC (likely already approved)
Add Credly badges (can implement quickly, adds value)
Pursue graduate credit through university partnership (takes 3-6 months)
Quick Win Strategy
For August 2024 start:

Use ESC's existing CEU authorization
Launch basic digital badge program
Market as "Graduate credit option coming Spring 2025"
Documentation Needed
Prepare these for any approval process:

Detailed curriculum with learning objectives
Instructor bios/qualifications
Assessment rubrics
Contact hour breakdown
Evaluation plan
Sample materials
Would you like me to draft a partnership proposal template for approaching universities or help create the CEU application materials?

just got some additonal ntoes: so here some additional notes .. do we follow this: Hello B,
Thanks for the notes. Here is what I know from Christy's conversation that she actually is ready to 
pay for!
Need a 2-hour Superintendent Professional Development overview of AI.
Need 9 sessions of a series of 2-hour monthly WCESC Leadership Team
Professional Development trainings.
All the other things she talked about I know have not been budgeted for. I think the vision
of her conversation is real. I suggest you keep exploring and that we/I communicate with
Christy to learn of questions, thoughts and new discoveries that support organizational
time savings strategies and techniques. As well as thoughts and strategies in district time
saving strategies and techniques.
I think the huge WIN could be thoughts and strategies on improving student teaching, learning and
growing experiences. Reaching learners differently and more efficiently/effectively. While also offering
support tools to assist classroom teachers in how to engage with ChatGPT (other AI tool) at deeper
levels other than simply asking a singular question. Thus helping learners learn better and supporting
parents and families with tools and strategies for better teaching, learning and growing experiences
at home.
I've attached a revision of your document for your review. I actually think at this time the document should
be a one pager (perhaps on page 1). Let's keep talking.
Christy doesn't know what she doesn't know, and she's not equipped YET with how to articulate what
she believes is possible, but I believe she can be the difference that makes a difference in WCESC and
beyond!
Most grateful,

----
does this change anything?

Edit

Refined professional development plan focusing on Christie's budget.
7s





Yes, this definitely changes our approach! Based on these notes, we need to streamline to focus on what Christie has actually budgeted for:

One 2-hour Superintendent PD session (overview)
Nine 2-hour monthly Leadership Team sessions
Let me create a more focused one-page overview followed by a simple implementation plan:
