# TechCred Third-Party Provider Model
## Compliance Structure for Ohio AI Education Initiative

---

## Executive Summary

TechCred requires **external third-party training providers** - employers cannot train their own staff internally. This clarifies our business model: **Your company becomes the TechCred-approved provider**, contracting with ESCs and districts to deliver training using a network of **independent contractor trainers**.

## TechCred Provider Requirements
