On a related note, are you familiar with Ohio’s TechCred Program?
https://techcred.ohio.gov/
This state-funded initiative allows districts to be reimbursed up to $2,000 per employee for completing industry-recognized credentials that enhance technology skills in the workplace. Training related to AI literacy and integration is eligible under this program.
For school districts to access this funding, the training provider (e.g., DYK) must be listed as an approved TechCred provider. Details on how to apply can be found at the link above. I’m also including a link to the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce’s AI in Education Strategy, which outlines the state's direction in this space:
