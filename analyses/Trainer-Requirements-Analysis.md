# Ohio Statewide AI Training: Trainer Requirements & Funding Analysis
## Mathematical Model for 95,000 Educators Across 600+ Districts

---

## Executive Summary

To train Ohio's 95,000 educators using a 30:1 trainer ratio and TechCred funding constraints of $180,000 per employer annually, we need **3,167 total trainers** operating over **7 years** to achieve complete statewide coverage.

---

## Key Constraints & Variables

### Training Structure
- **Educator Certification:** 20 hours
- **Trainer Certification:** 35 hours (20-hour base + 15-hour train-the-trainer)
- **Trainer-to-Participant Ratio:** 30:1
- **TechCred Reimbursement:** $2,000 per participant

### Funding Constraints
- **Per Employer Annual Cap:** $180,000 ($2,000 × 90 participants max)
- **Total Employers:** 600+ school districts + 51 ESCs = 651 potential employers
- **State Pool:** $190M+ available over multiple years

---

## Trainer Requirements Analysis

### Total Trainer Sessions Needed
```
95,000 educators ÷ 30 participants per trainer = 3,167 trainer sessions required
```

### Annual Training Capacity per Trainer
**Assumption:** Each trainer can deliver 4 cohorts per year
- 4 cohorts × 30 participants = 120 educators per trainer annually
- Each cohort = 20 hours delivered over 2-3 months

### Total Trainers Needed (Various Scenarios)

#### Scenario 1: 7-Year Implementation
```
95,000 educators ÷ 7 years = 13,571 educators per year
13,571 ÷ 120 (capacity per trainer) = 113 active trainers needed annually
```

#### Scenario 2: 5-Year Implementation  
```
95,000 educators ÷ 5 years = 19,000 educators per year
19,000 ÷ 120 = 158 active trainers needed annually
```

#### Scenario 3: 3-Year Implementation
```
95,000 educators ÷ 3 years = 31,667 educators per year
31,667 ÷ 120 = 264 active trainers needed annually
```

---

## TechCred Funding Mathematics

### Per-Employer Capacity
- **Annual Cap:** $180,000 per employer
- **Participants per Employer:** 90 annually (180,000 ÷ 2,000)
- **Total Ohio Employers:** 651 (600 districts + 51 ESCs)

### Statewide Annual Capacity
```
651 employers × 90 participants = 58,590 participants annually
651 employers × $180,000 = $117,180,000 annual funding capacity
```

### Multi-Year Implementation Required
```
95,000 total educators ÷ 58,590 annual capacity = 1.62 years minimum
```
**However:** Practical constraints require 3-7 year rollout
