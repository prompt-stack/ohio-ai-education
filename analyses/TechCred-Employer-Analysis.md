## Revised Statewide Funding Analysis

### **Total Annual TechCred Capacity (Educational Sector)**
| Employer Type | Count | Annual Cap Each | Total Annual Potential |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| School Districts | 600 | $180,000 | $108,000,000 |
| ESCs | 51 | $180,000 | $9,180,000 |
| JVSDs | 50 | $180,000 | $9,000,000 |
| Charter Schools | 300 | $180,000 | $54,000,000 |
| Higher Ed | 200 | $180,000 | $36,000,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **1,201** | | **$216,180,000** |

### **Participants Served Annually**
```
1,201 employers × 90 participants = 108,090 educators annually
```

### **Implications for 95,000 Educator Goal**
```
95,000 total educators ÷ 108,090 annual capacity = 0.88 years
```
**This means the entire state could theoretically be trained in under 1 year from a funding perspective!**

## Strategic Employer Application Approaches

### **Approach 1: District-Direct Model**
**Each district applies independently**

#### Advantages:
- Maximum funding capture ($180K per district)
- District retains full control
- Local economic development stays in district
- Direct relationship with TechCred program

#### Process:
1. District applies directly to TechCred
2. District contracts with training provider (us)
3. District manages participant enrollment
4. District receives reimbursement
5. District pays training provider

#### Example - Lakota Local Schools:
- Applies for $180,000 TechCred funding
- Trains 90 educators at $2,000 each
- Contracts with our program for delivery
- Keeps economic benefit local

### **Approach 2: ESC-Coordinated Model**
**ESC applies on behalf of member districts**

#### Advantages:
- Centralized coordination
- Economies of scale
- ESC expertise in grant management
- Simplified vendor management

#### Process:
1. ESC applies to TechCred for member districts
2. ESC coordinates training across multiple districts
3. ESC manages all TechCred compliance
4. ESC distributes training across region

#### Example - Warren County ESC Model:
- ESC applies for $180,000
- Coordinates training for 11 member districts
- Manages 90 participants across region
- Provides centralized administration

### **Approach 3: Hybrid Model**
**Large districts apply directly, small districts through ESC**

#### Strategic Split:
- **Large Districts (500+ educators):** Apply directly
- **Small Districts (<500 educators):** Apply through ESC
- **ESCs:** Apply for their own staff + small districts

#### Benefits:
- Maximizes total funding capture
- Appropriate complexity for district size
- Leverages ESC expertise where needed
- Maintains local control for large districts

## Revenue Model Implications

### **Revised Revenue Projections**
**Based on 1,201 potential employers:**

#### Annual Revenue Potential:
- **Maximum Theoretical:** $216,180,000 annually
- **Realistic Capture (50%):** $108,090,000 annually
